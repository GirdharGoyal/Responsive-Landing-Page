# Responsive-Landing-Page
A simple interactive navigation menu built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The navbar stays fixed at the top, changes color when scrolling, and includes smooth hover effects on menu items. This project improves user experience with clean design, responsive layout, and dynamic UI interactions.
